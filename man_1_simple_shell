.SH PATH 
is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating system
that tells the shell which directories to search for executable files 
in response to commands issued by a user. 
It increases both the convenience and the safety of such operating systems 
and is widely considered to be the single most important environmental variable.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
This variable, when and only when an interactive shell
is invoked, shall be subjected to parameter expansion by the shell
by the shell, and the resulting value shall be used as a pathname of 
a file containing shell commands to execute in the current environment.

.B name=value
.

The following commands are executed in the shell 

.B exit
